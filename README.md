# reusable-comment-component

To creat a reusable comment component, I defined custom HTML elements. I defined the user-comment element with attributes to take in the content, and I manually placed an unlimited number of identically structured and styled comments with different content in HTML. I used Custom Elements, which can take a name, email address, and comment as attributes, to display the name, email address, and attribute in a built-in custom layout.
